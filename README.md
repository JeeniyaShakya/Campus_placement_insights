# Campus_placement_insights

A five-year campus placement analysis project featuring:

- **Raw PDF placement reports** collected from the official institute website  
- **Extracted and cleaned CSV datasets** prepared after parsing PDF tables  
- **PostgreSQL data modeling** including schema design, data cleaning queries, transformations, and analytical SQL  
- **(Upcoming)** Power BI dashboard for company-wise, branch-wise, and year-wise insights  

This repository represents a complete **data engineering + BI workflow**, starting from raw data extraction to structured datasets and SQL-based analysis.
