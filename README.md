# 📊 Campus Placement Insights

## Problem Statement
Placement data for educational institutions is often published as scattered PDF reports across multiple academic years. These reports are difficult to analyze collectively, lack standardization, and do not provide clear insights into year-wise trends, branch-wise performance, or overall placement outcomes.  

As a result, students, academic planners, and stakeholders struggle to understand placement patterns and make data-driven decisions.

- Analyze **overall and branch-wise placement performance**  
- Create an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for insights  

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end data analytics workflow** from raw data extraction to business insights.
