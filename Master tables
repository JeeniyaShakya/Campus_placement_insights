# Campus Placement Insights

## Project Overview
Campus Placement Insights is a data analytics project designed to analyze campus placement trends over the past five years. The project focuses on transforming raw placement data into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready format using PostgreSQL and SQL, followed by visualization in Power BI.

## Data Modeling Approach

Initially, the raw placement data was stored across **10 intermediate tables**. These tables were created during the data extraction and cleaning phase and contained overlapping, redundant, and partially normalized information.

To improve data quality, reduce redundancy, and support efficient analysis, the data was consolidated into **three master tables** using SQL transformations and deduplication logic.

## Master Tables Description

### 1. Students Table (`students_master.csv`)
This table contains student-level information and serves as the core entity of the data model.

**Purpose:**
- Stores unique student records
- Eliminates duplicate student entries across multiple years
- Enables branch-wise and year-wise analysis

**Key Information:**
- Student identifiers
- Academic branch
- Graduation year
- Relevant demographic and academic attributes

---

### 2. Company Summary Table (`company_summary.csv`)
This table contains company-level information and acts as a reference dimension.

**Purpose:**
- Stores unique recruiting companies
- Avoids repeated company information across multiple placement records
- Supports analysis of company participation trends

**Key Information:**
- Company name
- Industry / sector (if applicable)
- Package-related summary fields

---

### 3. Company Placement Table (`company_placement.csv`)
This table represents the transactional placement data linking students and companies.

**Purpose:**
- Captures actual placement events
- Establishes relationships between students and recruiting companies
- Enables salary, year-wise, and branch-wise placement analysis

**Key Information:**
- Student reference
- Company reference
- Placement year
- Package offered

## Data Transformation & Queries

- SQL queries were used extensively to:
  - Clean and standardize raw data
  - Remove duplicate records
  - Normalize the data structure
  - Create relationships between students, companies, and placements
- Joins, aggregations, and filtering logic were applied to generate accurate master tables suitable for analytical use.

## Outcome
The final dataset enables:
- Overall placement trend analysis
- Branch-wise placement performance
- Company participation and package analysis
- Clear and scalable reporting in Power BI
